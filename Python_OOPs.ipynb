        "### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**, which can contain data (attributes) and code (methods). It focuses on organizing code using real-world models, making it reusable, modular, and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2Ô∏è‚É£ What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "A class is a **blueprint or template** for creating objects. It defines the attributes (variables) and behaviors (methods) that the created objects will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3Ô∏è‚É£ What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "An object is an **instance** of a class. It represents a specific entity that contains the data and behavior defined by its class.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- **Abstraction** hides complex implementation details and shows only essential features.\n",
        "- **Encapsulation** wraps data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricts direct access, protecting internal state.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5Ô∏è‚É£ What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "Dunder (double underscore) methods are **special methods** with names like `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`. They enable operator overloading, object initialization, and control of built-in behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "Inheritance allows a class (child) to **inherit** properties and methods from another class (parent), promoting code reuse and extending functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7Ô∏è‚É£ What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "Polymorphism means **one interface, many implementations**. It allows different classes to be treated as the same type through shared methods or interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8Ô∏è‚É£ How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "Encapsulation is achieved using **private (`_` or `__`) attributes** and providing public methods (getters/setters) to control access to the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9Ô∏è‚É£ What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "A constructor is a special method (`__init__`) that is **automatically called** when a new object is created, initializing the object‚Äôs attributes.\n",
        "\n",

        "### üîü What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- **Class method** (`@classmethod`) takes `cls` as the first parameter and can modify class state.\n",
        "- **Static method** (`@staticmethod`) does not take `self` or `cls` and behaves like a regular function inside the class.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 11Ô∏è‚É£ What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "Method overloading means **defining multiple methods with the same name** but different parameters. Python doesn‚Äôt support it directly but can mimic it using default or variable arguments.\n",
        "\n",

        "### 12Ô∏è‚É£ What is method overriding in OOP?\n",

        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 13Ô∏è‚É£ What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "The `@property` decorator allows a method to be accessed like an **attribute** (without parentheses), often used for computed or protected values.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 14Ô∏è‚É£ Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "Polymorphism provides **flexibility and scalability** by allowing code to handle objects of different classes through a common interface.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 15Ô∏è‚É£ What is an abstract class in Python?\n",

        "### 22Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` in Python?\n",
        "- `@staticmethod` has no access to class or instance.\n",
        "- `@classmethod` receives the class (`cls`) and can access/modify class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 23Ô∏è‚É£ How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "Polymorphism works by allowing child classes to **override parent methods** and still be accessed via parent references, enabling dynamic behavior.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 24Ô∏è‚É£ What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
