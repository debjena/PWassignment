        "# 1. Difference between interpreted and compiled languages\n",
        "# --------------------------------------------------------\n",
        "# - Interpreted languages execute code line-by-line at runtime (e.g., Python, JavaScript).\n",
        "# - Compiled languages translate the entire code into machine language before execution (e.g., C, C++).\n",
        "# Interpreted languages offer flexibility and ease of debugging; compiled languages are faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "# ----------------------------------------\n",
        "# It is a mechanism to catch and manage runtime errors using try, except, else, and finally blocks to avoid program crashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. Purpose of the finally block in exception handling\n",
        "# -----------------------------------------------------\n",
        "# The finally block contains code that always executes after try/except, regardless of whether an exception occurred. Often used for cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "# -----------------------------\n",
        "# Logging is recording runtime events or messages to help track program flow, debug, or record errors using Python’s logging module.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5. Significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        "# -----------------------------------------------\n",
        "# The __del__ method is a destructor called when an object is about to be destroyed, used to free resources or perform cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 6. Difference between import and from ... import\n",
        "# -------------------------------------------------\n",
        "# - import module imports the entire module, accessed via module.name.\n",
        "# - from module import name imports specific attributes/functions directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",

        "\n",
        "# 8. Purpose of the with statement when handling files\n",
        "# ----------------------------------------------------\n",

        "\n",
        "# 9. Difference between multithreading and multiprocessing\n",
        "# --------------------------------------------------------\n",
        "# - Multithreading: multiple threads within the same process share memory (good for I/O-bound tasks).\n",
        "# - Multiprocessing: multiple processes with separate memory (good for CPU-bound tasks).\n",
